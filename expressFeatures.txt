1. Middleware
Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object (req), the 
response object (res), 
and the next middleware function in the application's request-response cycle. 
They can execute code, modify the request 
and response objects, end the request-response cycle, and call the next middleware 
function. This modular approach helps in 
structuring the application.
2. Routing
Express provides a powerful routing system that allows developers to define 
routes for different HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) and URLs. 
This helps in organizing the application's endpoints and handling requests efficiently.
3. Templating Engines
Express supports various templating engines like Pug, EJS, and Handlebars. 
This allows developers to generate dynamic HTML pages by embedding JavaScript 
code within HTML templates.
4. Static File Serving
The framework can serve static files such as images, CSS, and JavaScript files.
 This is useful for delivering assets directly to the client without needing a 
 separate server.
5. Error Handling
Express provides a simple yet powerful mechanism for handling errors.
 Developers can define error-handling middleware to catch and respond to errors 
 in a centralized manner.
6. Database Integration
While Express itself does not come with a built-in database layer, it easily
 integrates with various databases and ORMs like MongoDB (using Mongoose), MySQL, 
 PostgreSQL, and others.
7. Scalability
Express is suitable for building both small-scale and large-scale applications.
 Its modular architecture allows developers to build scalable and maintainable applications.
8. Security
Express supports various security features like HTTPS, cookie management, and
 integration with security middleware like Helmet, which helps secure applications by 
 setting various HTTP headers.
9. Session Management
The framework supports session management, allowing developers to maintain user
 sessions and handle authentication and authorization.
10. Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)
Express allows easy setup of CORS, enabling controlled access to resources
 from different domains, which is essential for building APIs.
11. Flexibility
Express is unopinionated, meaning it doesn't impose a specific structure or
 set of tools. This allows developers to choose the best tools and libraries for their 
 specific needs.
12. Extensibility
With the ability to create and use custom middleware and plugins, Express is highly 
extensible, allowing developers to add new features and functionalities as needed.
13. Debugging
Express provides a debugging module that helps in tracing errors and understanding
 the flow of the application.
