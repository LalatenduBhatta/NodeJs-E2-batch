Indexing in MongoDB improves the performance of queries by allowing the database to quickly locate the necessary data without having to scan every document in a collection. Indexes store a small portion of the collectionâ€™s data in a sorted order, making searches faster and more efficient.

Indexes are special data structures that store information about the documents in a way that makes it easier for MongoDB to quickly locate the right data.

Creating an Index:-------
MongoDB provides a method called createIndex() that allows users to create an index. 
Syntax: 
db.collectionName.createIndex({KEY:1}) 
1 refers to the ascending order while -1 is for descending order indexing

Droping an Index:-------
syntax:
1)db.collectionName.dropIndex({KEY:indexType}) //to drop a specific field
2)db.collectionName.dropIndexes()  //to drop all except _id


Getting the Indexes:----
syntax:
db.collectionName.getIndexes() //return all the indexes with its types
